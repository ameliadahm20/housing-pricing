# Kings County Housing Prices
#### Flatiron School Data Science Program - Project 2<br>By Amelia Dahm<br>Oct. 23nd, 2020

## Background

With data exploration, statistical testing, and feature engineering, I developed a regression model to take variables that can predict the price of a house in Kings County in Seattle, Washington. This repository contains the files that lead to the final predictions for a holdout dataset that had not been trained on the model and do not have the prices included. 




### Deliverables:
1. [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ameliadahm20/housing-pricing)
2. [Jupyter Notebook](KingsCountyHousingPrices.ipynb)
3. [Holdout predictions](housing_preds_amelia_dahm.csv)
